# airpods-landing

This landing page was built as a personal exercise to practice HTML and CSS. It showcases a fictional brand called **Sonova**, which designs and builds futuristic airpods. My goal was to learn how to structure a webpage, apply styling, and create a clean, modern layout.

## 🚀 About the Project

- Built with **HTML** and **CSS**
- Includes hero section, features, testimonials, product cards, and footer
- Currently **not responsive**—I'm actively working on making it mobile-friendly
- Designed to simulate a real-world product landing page
